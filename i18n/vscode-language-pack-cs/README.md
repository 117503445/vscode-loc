# Czech Language Pack for VS Code

Czech Language Pack provides localized UI experience for VS Code.

## Usage

You can override the default UI language by explicitly setting the VS Code display language using the **Configure Display Language** command.

Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` to bring up the **Command Palette** then start typing `display` to filter and display the **Configure Display Language** command.

Press `Enter` and a list of installed languages by locale is displayed, with the current locale highlighted. Select another `locale` to switch UI language.

See [Docs](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=761051) for more information.

## Contributing

For feedback of translation improvement, please create Issue in [vscode-loc](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-loc) repo.

The translation strings are maintained in Microsoft Localization Platform. Change can only be made in Microsoft Localization Platform then export to vscode-loc repo. So pull request won't be accepted in vscode-loc repo.
